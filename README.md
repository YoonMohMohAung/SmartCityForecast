# 🌦️⚡ Smart City Weather & Energy Forecasting System

### Using Government Open Data & Time Series Forecasting

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to develop a **Smart City Forecasting System** that
predicts both **weather conditions** and **energy consumption** using
government open data and time series forecasting techniques.

By combining weather and energy datasets, this system demonstrates how
climate factors influence electricity demand --- a critical insight for
**urban planning**, **energy optimization**, and **smart city
management**.

The project integrates classical statistical models and modern machine
learning models into a **production-ready forecasting API** with an
interactive dashboard.

## 🎯 Objectives

-   🌡️ Temperature\
-   🌧️ Rainfall\
-   ⚡ Electricity demand

Analyze weather impact on energy consumption, build ML system using
official data, deploy scalable API and dashboard.

## 🏙️ Use Cases

Smart city planning, energy load balancing, optimization, resilience,
peak detection.

## 📂 Data Sources

Weather & Energy from government open data portals (data.go.th, eia.gov,
meteostat.net)

## 🧠 Models

ARIMA, SARIMA, SARIMAX, XGBoost, Random Forest, LSTM, GRU

## ⚙️ Architecture

Government Data → Processing → Models → FastAPI → Dashboard

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Python, FastAPI, Vue/Streamlit, Docker
